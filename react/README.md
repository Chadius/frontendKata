## Counter
Setting up the project, learning enough of React to get started.

## Temperature Converter
Fahr-en-heit: Spelling the name was hard.

Test cases were fun to math my way around.

## Flight Booker
The most difficult part was writing enough test cases to separate the logic. There's difficulty in separating the pure logic from what to display.

Right now keep the front end as dumb as possible, so I don't have to test inputs.

## Timer
I was almost done when I noticed a surprise requirement: The timer has to stop when it maxes out and start once the duration is increased.
UseEffect when you need an external system (like a timer).
Also, in the Use Effect you need to delete the timer - JavaScript scopes the timer outside the page so rerendering will not get rid of it.

## CRUD
Finally.
Lots of testing but otherwise it's looking good.
I just need to design and css it.

# Project notes
## Jest config
Make sure you copy the jest config file to your project, or it trips when it tries to use Typescript.
